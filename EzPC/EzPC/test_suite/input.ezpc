	Following shows usage of input statement.
	In general, syntax is 
		input(<CLIENT/SERVER>, variable name, type),
		where type can be either base type like int32_al, int32_pl, int64_al, int64_pl, bool_bl
		or array types made of base types (like int32_al[2][2])

	input(SERVER, w, uint32_al);
	input(SERVER, x, uint32_bl);
	input(SERVER, z, uint32_al[10]);
	input(CLIENT, a, uint32_al[10][100]);
	input(SERVER, b, bool_bl);
	input(SERVER, c, bool_bl);
